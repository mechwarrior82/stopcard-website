<h1>Be Secure With A STOPCARD<sup>&reg;</sup></h1>

<h2>Modern Technology</h2>

<p>
Our Modern society demands speed and ease of access.  The creation of enhanced wireless technologies has given us a high level of convenience, but everyone should be cognizant of a fully digitized world.  The latest in wireless technologies have enabled card manufacturers to store your personal information in a miniature microprocessor that is embedded within your credit/debit cards and I.D.s – this microprocessor uses wireless signals to communicate. This technology is known as RFID - Radio Frequency Identification. It allows a remote reading device to transmit a wireless data collection signal to your RFID enabled cards in order for your cards to transmit back your stored personal information. Passports now include these RFID chips that contain very important and unique information about you. Many government I.D.s and personal bank cards already incorporate this RFID technology.

<h2>The Risk</h2>

<p>
All it takes to access this critical personal information is a simple, readily available, low cost RFID reader.  RFID enabled ID or "Contactless" smart credit cards can be scanned and read right through your purse, wallet or pocket.  The reader can be hidden out of sight and can be used without you ever being aware that it is scanning you. This wireless technology gives identity thieves the ability to steal your personal information without ever having direct contact with your credit cards or other personal belongings. This makes it almost impossible for you to protect yourself from this invisible threat.

<h2>The Impact On You</h2>

<p>
Identity Theft is one of the worst things that can happen to you. It takes significant time, money and effort to recover from such an attack against you. You are often unaware of such an attack until you are ready to make an important transaction such as buy a new home or car.
</p>

<h2>The Solution</h2>

<p>
So how do you protect yourself in this new wireless environment? The solution is simple - the STOPCARD<sup>&reg;</sup>. The STOPCARD<sup>&reg;</sup> is an active countermeasure against this kind of stealth threat. The STOPCARD<sup>&reg;</sup> prevents your RFID enabled cards from being able to reveal their valuable information without your consent.

The STOPCARD<sup>&reg;</sup> is the most innovative solution for RFID protection. It creates an active shield that protects your RFID enabled credit cards and I.D.s from being scanned when you don’t want them to be. It is the first active defense countermeasure on the market today. It provides a protective RF shield with an extended range compared to a simple passive substitute (foil shield). The card works to protect all forms of RFID cards you may own (Passports, Credit and Debit Cards, ID Cards, Secure Entry Badges).
